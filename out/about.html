        <p>Gus Mingst is from the mean streets of Santa Monica, and he’s seen things and been through things that most people in their little pearly lofts couldn't even relate to. For example: one day, he was minding his own business in a park and this stranger took a piece of gum out of his pocket, put it in his mouth, and he just threw a wrapper on the ground. He publicly littered. He publicly littered and Gus saw that. He had to see these things at a young age. Sure somebody came along, somebody picked it up, somebody threw it in the trash can. But for the few moments where that sat on the ground the law was violated, right there in his neighborhood. Another time he was on the sidewalk and he watched a guy cross the street. He was not even within the lines -- he publicly jaywalked. There was a police officer standing right there. There were years where his father didn't even make a hundred grand or barely made a hundred grand and sure, he had a maid, but she only came twice a week. What do you think happened the other five days? You think those dishes washed themselves? You think those clothes got themself in the hamper? His neighbors were twins. They got a Mercedes for their birthday, but just one -- they had to share that car. “Who gets to drive today”, they would ask. He had to see these things. Most people haven't seen the things he's seen. They haven't been down that way, they haven't been to the mean streets of Santa Monica.
